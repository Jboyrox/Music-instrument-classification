# Music-instrument-classification
In this experiment I:</br>
1)Load a file from a URL</br>
2)Extract simple features from audio samples for machine learning tasks such as speech recognition and classification</br>
3)Build a simple neural network for music classification using these features</br>
4)Use a callback to store the loss and accuracy history in the training process</br>
5)Optimize the learning rate of the neural network</br>
Given a sample of music,I determine which instrument (e.g. trumpet, violin, piano) is playing. This dataset was generously supplied by Prof. Juan Bello at NYU Stenihardt and his former PhD student Eric Humphrey (now at Spotify).</br>
The results of this experiment are present in the notebook music.ipynb
